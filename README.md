# Rice_FM-Model

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the revenue performance of ABC company's rice sales over the next five years. By analyzing the pricing dynamics, including selling and buying prices, as well as the impact of maintenance and delivery charges on profit margins, we seek to forecast the company's revenue and understand the implications of various factors on its financial performance.

The project considers a selling price range of 42-220 Rs per kg and a buying price range of 18-26 Rs per kg, with corresponding adjustments for maintenance and delivery charges. The initial sales volume for the first year is set at 2000 tonnes. The analysis also incorporates an 11% annual increment in buying prices, leading to adjustments in selling prices. Additionally, there is a yearly increment of 0.5% in maintenance charges and 0.8% in delivery charges. A tax rate of 4% is applied to the total revenue for each year.

By examining these factors and their cumulative impact, this project aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations to optimize revenue generation for ABC company's rice sales in the upcoming years.
